## Drinking Roulette

This is a side project I made for trial purposes.

The goal is to develop a website to be used for entertainment.

Users, gathered with their friends and some drinks, Spin the wheel so they can get a question. They can either follow the instructions, or take a shot.

Will update with the demo once deployed


## Needed Credits

The Roulette componant was taken from this [Github Repo](https://github.com/CamWang/react-spin-wheel).

Most other components were taken from [UiVerse](https://uiverse.io/).

Credits to respective owners.

The components were exported and then customized by me to fit the needs of this project.
